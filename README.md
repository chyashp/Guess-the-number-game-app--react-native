Guess My Number
Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my "Guess My Number" mobile game built with React Native and Expo.
What's this all about?
This is a fun little game where you pick a number, and your phone tries to guess it. It's a twist on the classic guessing game - instead of you doing the guessing, your device does!
The game tracks how many attempts it takes for your phone to figure out your number. The fewer rounds it takes, the "smarter" your phone seems to be!
How to play
Choose a secret number when you start the game
The app will make a guess
Give the app hints - tell it if your number is higher or lower
Keep going until the app guesses correctly
See the final score - how many rounds it took to guess your number
Challenge yourself or friends to stump the app for as long as possible!
Built with:
React Native
Expo
Custom UI components

This was a fun project to practice React Native fundamentals, state management, and creating a polished user experience with custom styling.
